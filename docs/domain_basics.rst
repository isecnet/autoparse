Cybersecurity Basics
====================

Cybersecurity is the set of applying security preventions to provide confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of data. In this section, we explain the well-known triad of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information security.

**Confidentiality** aims to restrict disclosures and to grant access of information to only the
authorised people. There are various ways of ensuring confidentiality such as encryption,
access controls, and steganography (the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or
video within another file, message, image, or video, e.g. making text the same colour as the
background in word processor documents, e-mails, and forum posts.)

**Integrity** requires protecting data in a consistent, precise, and reliable manner. This has
to guarantee that data is not altered in the course of a specific period. Hashing, digital
signatures, certificates, non-repudiation are the tools and algorithms providing integrity.

**Availability** is another security concept that the data and resources should be available
when people need to access it, particularly during emergencies or disasters. The cybersecurity
specialists should handle the three common challenges for availability; denial of service (DoS),
loss of information system capabilities because of natural disasters and equipment failures
during a normal operation.
